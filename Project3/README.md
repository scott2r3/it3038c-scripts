# SecretMessage
**SecretMessage is a program that takes any plaintext message and encrypts it. It has a basic mode with a set shift number or you can do the ceaser mode that you set the shift number etc.** 

## How to run script
<sub>The script will run in any python compilier or any code compilier. 
The script will open with a welcome message followed by a select set of options. You will follow the prompts exactly and if you do not by accident that is ok as it will direct you back into the menu you were in. This program encrypts and decrypts.</sub>

## Output
<sub>The script will return a encrypted message and you MUST copy and paste that encrypted message back in yourself when doing the decryption. When doing the Ceaser method you also need to remember your shift number as well.</sub>
