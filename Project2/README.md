# Alarm Script

**The alarm script is as it says, it is a short alarm you can use to remind yourself when to stop doing what you are doing.** 

## How to run script
<sub>The script will run in any python compilier. 
It will ask for a time to wait in seconds and also what alarm message you want to appear when time is up. Those two messages will appear in that order after you press run</sub>

## Output
<sub>The script will return a message after the time you entered runs out asking you to stop or whatever you want.</sub>

**I used the youtube channel freeCodeCamp.org. They helped explain the time module to me and how to display stuff but I will add that next.**
